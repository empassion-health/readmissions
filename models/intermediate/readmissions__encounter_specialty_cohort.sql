-- Here we list the specialty cohort for each encounter that has
-- an associated specialty cohort.
-- There are 5 possible specialty cohorts:
--      [1] Medicine
--      [2] Surgery/Gynecology
--      [3] Cardiology
--      [4] Cardiovascular
--      [5] Neurology
-- An encounter that has an ICD-10-PCS procedure code or a
-- CCS procedure category that corresponds to the
-- 'Surgery/Gynecology' cohort will always be in that cohort.
-- For encounters that are not in the 'Surgery/Gynecology' cohort,
-- we then check to see if they are in one of the other 4 cohorts.
